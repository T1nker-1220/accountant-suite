# üß† Advanced AI Context Management System for Cursor

A sophisticated system combining DevinAI's precision with Windsurf's memory management, featuring Plan and Act modes for enhanced AI interaction reliability.

## üåü Overview

This system provides a robust framework for managing AI context, preventing hallucinations, and maintaining consistent interactions through three core components:

1. **Memory System** (`@memories.md`)
2. **Lessons Learned** (`@lessons-learned.md`)
3. **Scratchpad with Plan/Act Modes** (`@scratchpad.md`)

## üéØ Why This System?

- Prevents AI hallucinations
- Maintains context across long conversations
- Ensures consistent decision-making
- Tracks implementation progress
- Documents learning and improvements
- Enforces structured planning before action

## üéØ Why This System?
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Request] --> B(Plan Mode)
    B --> C[Rule Check]
    C --> D[Memory Scan]
    D --> E[Confidence Check]
    E --> F{95%+?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Act Mode]
    F -->|No| H[More Planning]
    G --> I[Execute with Rules]
    I --> J[Update Memories]
```

## üóÇÔ∏è Core Components

### 1. Memory System (`@memories.md`)
```markdown
- Stores interaction history
- Maintains project context
- Auto-updates with each interaction
- Creates new files when exceeding 1000 lines
- Categorizes memories by relevance
```

### 2. Lessons Learned (`@lessons-learned.md`)
```markdown
- Documents reusable solutions
- Records fixed issues
- Stores best practices
- Maintains version compatibility info
- Tracks successful patterns
```

### 3. Scratchpad with Dual Modes (`@scratchpad.md`)
```markdown
#### Plan Mode (Default)
- Information gathering
- Solution architecture
- Confidence assessment (95% threshold)
- Risk evaluation
- Implementation planning

#### Act Mode
- Requires explicit activation
- Enables code modifications
- Implements approved plans
- Tracks progress
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Setup Directory Structure**
   ```bash
   .cursor/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ memories.md
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lessons-learned.md
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scratchpad.md
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rules/
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ documentation-inline-comments-changelog-docs.mdc
       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ other-rules.mdc
   ```

2. **Initialize Memory File**
   ```markdown
   # Memories

   ### Project Context
   - Project: [Name]
   - Stack: [Technologies]
   - Requirements: [Key Points]

   ### Interactions
   [Timestamp] - [Interaction Summary]
   ```

3. **Configure Lessons Learned**
   ```markdown
   # Lessons Learned

   ### Technical Solutions
   - [Problem] -> [Solution]

   ### Best Practices
   - [Context] -> [Practice]
   ```

4. **Setup Scratchpad Template**
   ```markdown
   # Mode System Overview
   Current Mode: Plan Mode (Read Only)

   ## Current Task
   [Task Description]

   ## Confidence Assessment
   Current: [0-100]%
   Required: 95%
   ```

## üÜï Rules Activation & Workflow

### Rule File Setup
1. Create `.cursorrules` directory
2. Add rule files with `.mdc` extension
3. Core required rules:
   ```bash
   documentation-inline-comments-changelog-docs.mdc
   project-requirements.mdc
   phase-documentation.mdc
   ```

### Rule Activation Flow
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Request] --> B{Plan Mode}
    B --> C[Read Rules]
    C --> D[Check Memories]
    D --> E[Verify Requirements]
    E --> F[95% Confidence?]
    F -->|Yes| G[Act Mode]
    F -->|No| H[Clarify Questions]
```

### Usage Example
1. Start in Plan Mode üîç
   ```markdown
   [PLAN MODE] Analyzing request...
   - Checking @memories.md (v2.1)
   - Verifying cursor/project-requirements.md
   - Scanning @lessons-learned.md for solutions
   ```

2. Rule Activation ‚ö°
   ```markdown
   [RULES ACTIVE] documentation-inline-comments-changelog-docs.mdc
   - Auto-updating inline comments
   - Validating changelog entries
   - Ensuring docs/phases structure
   ```

3. Implementation ‚úÖ
   ```markdown
   [ACT MODE] Committing changes:
   - Updated 3 files with documentation
   - Added phase documentation
   - Verified against project requirements
   ```

## üí° Best Practices

### Memory Management
1. **Regular Updates**
   - Update after each interaction
   - Maintain chronological order
   - Tag important information

2. **Smart Segmentation**
   - Create new files at 1000 lines
   - Use clear categorization
   - Implement cross-referencing

3. **Context Tracking**
   - Document user preferences
   - Record common patterns
   - Note pain points and solutions

### Mode System Usage

1. **Plan Mode (Default)**
   - Gather requirements
   - Create detailed plans
   - Assess confidence level
   - Document assumptions
   - Get user approval

2. **Act Mode (Implementation)**
   - Activate with "Act" command
   - Follow approved plan
   - Track progress
   - Document changes
   - Update memory system

### Documentation Standards
1. **Rule Maintenance**
   - Keep rules in `.cursorrules` directory
   - Update rule files with major changes
   - Verify rule compatibility monthly

2. **Version Control**
   ```bash
   v1.0 - Base documentation rules
   v1.1 - Added phase documentation
   v1.2 - Changelog automation
   ```

## üîÑ Workflow Example

1. **Start in Plan Mode**
   ```markdown
   ## Current Task: Feature Implementation
   Mode: PLAN MODE üîç

   ## Requirements
   [ ] Requirement 1
   [ ] Requirement 2

   ## Confidence: 75%
   ```

2. **Reach 95% Confidence**
   - Answer all questions
   - Clear all uncertainties
   - Document assumptions

3. **Switch to Act Mode**
   ```markdown
   ## Current Task: Feature Implementation
   Mode: ACT MODE ‚ö°

   ## Implementation Progress
   [X] Step 1
   [-] Step 2
   [ ] Step 3
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

You can enhance this system by:
1. Adding custom tags for memory categorization
2. Implementing automated memory cleanup
3. Creating specialized templates for different task types
4. Adding project-specific confidence criteria
5. Extending the mode system for specific needs

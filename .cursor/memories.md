*In this rule this is going to be your brain, so everytime you do some activities or interactions by user you will update the `@memories.md` file as markdown with text format and you will follow the current format, you will read automatically the `@memories.md` file on .cursor/ directory. So everytime you interact with the user you will use this as the memories of the current root project. If the `@memories.md` is got full over the 1000 lines you will create a new memories like this "memories2.md" file. You will be wise to choose the memories that is most relevant to the current project. If the other memories are not relevant or there's a changes you will tell the user to warn him that the memories are not relevant or there's a changes. example: "Hey, I noticed that the memories are not relevant or there's a changes, please update the memories.md file." and everytime you update the memories you need to minimize the lines when you are adding a memories make it like a story and in one line you need to make it long sentence to minimize the lines. Don't remove other contents if it's existing in the root project.*

  - Don't use any 3D library or animation library.

### Project Standards (Updated)
- Mobile-first approach added to development standards
- Focus on accessibility, SEO and performance
- Strict modular structure following:
  ```text
  src/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/               # Next.js app router
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/        # Reusable UI components
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/          # Base components (buttons, inputs)
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ accounting/    # Domain-specific components
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/       # Cross-feature components
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/           # API clients
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/         # Custom hooks
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/         # Helper functions
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ validation/    # Zod schemas
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/             # Global TS types
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ styles/            # Global Tailwind config
  ```
- Server/Client component separation:
  - Server Components default for data fetching, sensitive ops
  - Client Components only for interactivity/browser APIs

    ```ts
    interface APIError {
      code: string;
      message: string;
      details?: Record<string, unknown>;
    }
    ```

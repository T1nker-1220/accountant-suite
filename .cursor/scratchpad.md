*This scratchpad file serves as a phase-specific task tracker and implementation planner. The Mode System on Line 1 is critical and must never be deleted. It defines two core modes: Implementation Type for new feature development and Bug Fix Type for issue resolution. Each mode requires specific documentation formats, confidence tracking, and completion criteria. Use "plan" trigger for planning phase (üéØ) and "agent" trigger for execution phase (‚ö°) after reaching 95% confidence. Follow strict phase management with clear documentation transfer process.*

`MODE SYSTEM TYPES (DO NOT DELETE!):
1. Implementation Type (New Features):
   - Trigger: User requests new implementation
   - Format: MODE: Implementation, FOCUS: New functionality
   - Requirements: Detailed planning, architecture review, documentation
   - Process: Plan mode (üéØ) ‚Üí 95% confidence ‚Üí Agent mode (‚ö°)

2. Bug Fix Type (Issue Resolution):
   - Trigger: User reports bug/issue
   - Format: MODE: Bug Fix, FOCUS: Issue resolution
   - Requirements: Problem diagnosis, root cause analysis, solution verification
   - Process: Plan mode (üéØ) ‚Üí Chain of thought analysis ‚Üí Agent mode (‚ö°)

     - Constraints
   - [ ] Local ‚Üí Cloud migration tool
     - Data mapping
     - Migration scripts
     - Progress tracking
     - Error handling
   - [ ] Data encryption at rest
     - Encryption methods

     - Merge strategies
     - Version control
     - Data integrity

3. Advanced CSV Handling (3 days)
   - [ ] Bulk import/export
     - File parsing
     - Data validation
     - Progress tracking
     - Error handling
   - [ ] Data validation rules
     - Rule engine
     - Custom validations
     - Error reporting
   - [ ] Template system
     - Template creation
     - Mapping rules
     - Default values
   - [ ] Error reporting
     - Detailed messages
     - Recovery options
     - Logging system

### Progress Tracking
- Current Phase: 2 - Data Management
- Status: Planning Stage
- Confidence: 85% (Need clarification on some points)

### Questions for Implementation
1. Authentication System:
   - Which social login providers should we integrate? (e.g., Google, GitHub)
   - What are the specific password requirements for local auth?
   - Should we implement 2FA?
   - What user profile fields are needed beyond basics?

2. Cloud Migration:
   - What's the estimated data volume for initial migration?
   - Do we need a staging environment for testing?
   - What's the acceptable downtime window for migration?
   - How should we handle existing data conflicts?

3. CSV Handling:
   - What are the required CSV column mappings?
   - Should we support multiple CSV formats?
   - What validation rules are needed?
   - How should we handle partial import failures?

### Next Steps
1. **Authentication System**
   ```
   - Set up Supabase project
   - Configure authentication providers
   - Implement user profile management
   - Set up RBAC system
   ```

2. **Cloud Migration**
   ```
   - Design database schema
   - Create migration scripts
   - Implement encryption
   - Add conflict resolution
   ```

3. **CSV Handling**
   ```
   - Build import/export system
   - Create validation engine
   - Implement template system
   - Add error handling
   ```

### Dependencies
- Supabase SDK
- CSV parsing library
- Encryption libraries
- Validation framework

### Security Considerations
- Implement AES-256 encryption
- Use secure session management
- Add rate limiting
- Implement audit logging
- Follow GDPR requirements

### Documentation Requirements
- API documentation
- Database schema
- Security protocols
- User guides
- Migration guides

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Before proceeding, we need clarification on:
1. Social login requirements
2. Data volume estimates
3. CSV format specifications
4. Validation rule details

Please provide these details so we can achieve 95% confidence and move to implementation phase. üòä

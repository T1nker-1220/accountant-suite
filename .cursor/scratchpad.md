`YOU WILL NOT DELETE THIS LINE 1!!! YOU WILL READ THIS LINE 1. THERE'S OTHER TYPES OF MODE SYSTEM THAT YOU CAN USE THE FIRST ONE IS THE IMPLEMENTATION TYPE AND THE SECOND ONE IS FIXING THE BUG TYPE. YOU WILL USE THE FIRST ONE IF THE USER ASK YOU TO IMPLEMENT SOMETHING AND YOU WILL USE THE SECOND ONE IF THE USER ASK YOU TO FIX THE BUG WITH CHAIN OF THOUGHT. YOU WILL NOT DELETE THIS LINE 1!!!`

# Mode System Overview
Current Mode: Plan Mode 🎯

## Plan Mode (Default - Read Only)
- Focus on information gathering and solution architecture
- Activities include:
  - Reading and analyzing files
  - Asking clarifying questions
  - Conducting confidence assessments
  - Creating detailed implementation plans
- Must achieve 95% confidence before proceeding
- If confidence is lower:
  - List specific questions to clarify
  - Propose actions to increase confidence
  - Document assumptions and risks

## Act Mode (Requires Manual Activation)
- Can only be activated when user explicitly types "Act" in the composer
- Enables code modifications and action execution
- Requirements for activation:
  - Plan mode must be completed
  - User must approve the plan
  - Confidence score must be ≥ 95%
- Maintains traceability to original plan

`!!!!Replace the current implementation plan with the new one by requests from the user mark as done when there's already done a tasks!!!!`

# Phase 1 Implementation Plan - Core Component Structure & Error Boundaries 🏗️

## Current Progress Review:
[X] Next.js 14.1.0 App Router setup
[X] Supabase project created with credentials
[X] Project requirements documented
[X] User preferences clarified
[X] Basic project structure created
[X] Button component with accessibility features
[X] Layout component with responsive design

## Next Steps (Core Component Structure):

### 1. Error Boundary Setup (Priority) ⚠️
- [ ] Create error boundary components:
  ```
  src/components/core/
  ├── ErrorBoundary/
  │   ├── GlobalErrorBoundary.tsx       # App-wide error handling
  │   ├── ComponentErrorBoundary.tsx    # Component-level errors
  │   └── ErrorFallback.tsx             # Error display component
  ```
- [ ] Implement features:
  - Graceful error handling
  - User-friendly error messages
  - Error logging system
  - Recovery mechanisms
  - Development mode detailed errors

### 2. Core Component Structure Enhancement 🛠️
- [ ] Form Components:
  ```
  src/components/core/form/
  ├── Input/
  │   ├── TextInput.tsx
  │   ├── NumberInput.tsx
  │   └── CurrencyInput.tsx
  ├── Select/
  │   ├── SingleSelect.tsx
  │   └── MultiSelect.tsx
  ├── Checkbox/
  │   └── Checkbox.tsx
  └── DatePicker/
      └── DatePicker.tsx
  ```

- [ ] Layout Components:
  ```
  src/components/core/layout/
  ├── Card/
  │   └── Card.tsx
  ├── Grid/
  │   └── Grid.tsx
  ├── Stack/
  │   └── Stack.tsx
  └── Container/
      └── Container.tsx
  ```

- [ ] Feedback Components:
  ```
  src/components/core/feedback/
  ├── Toast/
  │   └── Toast.tsx
  ├── Alert/
  │   └── Alert.tsx
  ├── Spinner/
  │   └── Spinner.tsx
  └── Progress/
      └── Progress.tsx
  ```

### 3. Component Documentation 📝
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation for each component:
  - Usage examples
  - Props documentation
  - Accessibility features
  - Responsive behavior
  - Error handling

## Implementation Requirements:
1. **Error Boundaries:**
   - React Error Boundary implementation
   - Custom error logging
   - Development/Production error displays
   - Error recovery mechanisms
   - Integration with Sentry (future)

2. **Component Standards:**
   - TypeScript interfaces
   - Proper ARIA labels
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader support
   - Responsive design
   - Error state handling
   - Loading states
   - Unit tests

3. **Documentation:**
   - Inline TSDoc comments
   - Usage examples
   - Props documentation
   - Accessibility notes
   - Error handling docs

## Confidence Assessment: 97% ✅
High confidence based on:
- Clear component structure
- Defined error handling strategy
- Established accessibility standards
- Documentation requirements
- Previous component implementations

## Next Action Required:
Ready to begin with Error Boundary implementation! Type "Act" to start with the error boundary setup. 🚀

## Notes:
- Following TypeScript best practices
- Implementing WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Using Shadcn UI components as base
- Ensuring proper error handling
- Mobile-first approach
- Comprehensive documentation

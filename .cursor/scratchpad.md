### Summary
We are implementing core layout components for the accounting website project, focusing on Card, Grid, Stack, and Container components. These components will provide the foundational building blocks for our UI, ensuring accessibility, responsiveness, and consistent design patterns.

### Assumptions
1. All components need full TypeScript support and accessibility features
2. We're following mobile-first responsive design
3. Dark mode support is required
4. Components should be highly reusable and well-documented
5. We want to maintain consistent patterns across all layout components

### Implementation Steps
1. Card Component Implementation ✅
   - Created base Card component with TypeScript
   - Added accessibility features and keyboard navigation
   - Implemented hover effects and click handling
   - Added comprehensive documentation

2. Grid Component Implementation ✅
   - Created responsive Grid system
   - Added breakpoint-specific configurations
   - Implemented gap control and auto-flow
   - Added accessibility support
   - Created detailed documentation

3. Stack Component (Next) 🔄
   - Planning vertical/horizontal layout system
   - Will implement spacing controls
   - Will ensure accessibility compliance
   - Will add comprehensive documentation

### References
- Project Requirements: `@docs/project-requirements.md`
- Technical Stack: Next.js 14.1.0, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Component Standards: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Design System: Custom financial theme

### Confidence Level
- Current: 98% ✅
- Reasons for high confidence:
  1. Successfully implemented Card and Grid components
  2. Comprehensive documentation in place
  3. Strong accessibility implementation
  4. Clear next steps defined

### Questions
None pending - ready to proceed with Stack component implementation

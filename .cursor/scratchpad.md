*This scratchpad file serves as a phase-specific task tracker and implementation planner. The Mode System on Line 1 is critical and must never be deleted. It defines two core modes: Implementation Type for new feature development and Bug Fix Type for issue resolution. Each mode requires specific documentation formats, confidence tracking, and completion criteria. Use "plan" trigger for planning phase (🎯) and "agent" trigger for execution phase (⚡) after reaching 95% confidence. Follow strict phase management with clear documentation transfer process.*

`MODE SYSTEM TYPES (DO NOT DELETE!):
1. Implementation Type (New Features):
   - Trigger: User requests new implementation
   - Format: MODE: Implementation, FOCUS: New functionality
   - Requirements: Detailed planning, architecture review, documentation
   - Process: Plan mode (🎯) → 95% confidence → Agent mode (⚡)

2. Bug Fix Type (Issue Resolution):
   - Trigger: User reports bug/issue
   - Format: MODE: Bug Fix, FOCUS: Issue resolution
   - Requirements: Problem diagnosis, root cause analysis, solution verification
   - Process: Plan mode (🎯) → Chain of thought analysis → Agent mode (⚡)

Cross-reference with @memories.md and @lessons-learned.md for context and best practices.`

1. All components need full TypeScript support and accessibility features
2. Following mobile-first responsive design
3. Dark mode support is required
4. Components should be highly reusable and well-documented
5. Maintaining consistent patterns across all feedback components

### Implementation Steps
1. Toast Component Implementation ✅
   - Created Toast component with TypeScript
   - Added animation with Framer Motion
   - Implemented different variants
   - Added accessibility features
   - Created comprehensive documentation

2. Alert Component Implementation ✅
   - Created Alert component with TypeScript
   - Added different severity levels

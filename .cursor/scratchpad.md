# Mode System Overview
Current Mode: Plan Mode 🎯

## Plan Mode (Default - Read Only)
- Focus on information gathering and solution architecture
- Activities include:
  - Reading and analyzing files
  - Asking clarifying questions
  - Conducting confidence assessments
  - Creating detailed implementation plans
- Must achieve 95% confidence before proceeding
- If confidence is lower:
  - List specific questions to clarify
  - Propose actions to increase confidence
  - Document assumptions and risks

## Act Mode (Requires Manual Activation)
- Can only be activated when user explicitly types "Act" in the composer
- Enables code modifications and action execution
- Requirements for activation:
  - Plan mode must be completed
  - User must approve the plan
  - Confidence score must be ≥ 95%
- Maintains traceability to original plan

# Phase 1 Implementation Plan - Core Component Structure & Error Boundaries 🏗️

## Current Progress Review:
[X] Next.js 14.1.0 App Router setup
[X] Supabase project created with credentials
[X] Project requirements documented
[X] User preferences clarified
[X] Basic project structure created
[X] Button component with accessibility features
[X] Layout component with responsive design
[X] Form Components Implementation:
    [X] TextInput component with validation and accessibility
    [X] NumberInput with min/max validation
    [X] CurrencyInput with formatting
    [X] SingleSelect with search and keyboard navigation
    [X] MultiSelect with tags and search
    [X] Checkbox and CheckboxGroup components
    [X] DatePicker with Calendar component
    [X] Index files for easy imports

## Next Steps (Core Component Structure):

### 1. Error Boundary Setup (Priority) ⚠️
[X] Create error boundary components:
  ```
  src/components/core/
  ├── ErrorBoundary/
  │   ├── GlobalErrorBoundary.tsx       # App-wide error handling
  │   ├── ComponentErrorBoundary.tsx    # Component-level errors
  │   └── ErrorFallback.tsx             # Error display component
  ```
[X] Implement features:
  - Graceful error handling
  - User-friendly error messages
  - Error logging system
  - Recovery mechanisms
  - Development mode detailed errors

### 2. Core Component Structure Enhancement 🛠️
[X] Layout Components:
  ```
  src/components/core/layout/
  ├── Card/
  │   ├── Card.tsx            # ✅ Completed
  │   ├── index.ts           # ✅ Completed
  │   └── README.md          # ✅ Completed
  ├── Grid/                  # 🔄 Next up
  │   └── Grid.tsx
  ├── Stack/
  │   └── Stack.tsx
  └── Container/
      └── Container.tsx
  ```

[-] Grid Component Implementation (In Progress):
  - Responsive grid system
  - Gap control
  - Column configuration
  - Breakpoint support
  - Auto-flow options

[ ] Feedback Components (Next Up):
  ```
  src/components/core/feedback/
  ├── Toast/
  │   └── Toast.tsx
  ├── Alert/
  │   └── Alert.tsx
  ├── Spinner/
  │   └── Spinner.tsx
  └── Progress/
      └── Progress.tsx
  ```

### 3. Component Documentation 📝
[-] Create comprehensive documentation for each component:
  [X] Form components documentation
  [X] Error boundary documentation
  [ ] Layout components documentation
  [ ] Feedback components documentation

## Implementation Requirements:
1. **Error Boundaries:** ✅
   - React Error Boundary implementation
   - Custom error logging
   - Development/Production error displays
   - Error recovery mechanisms
   - Integration with Sentry (future)

2. **Component Standards:** ✅
   - TypeScript interfaces
   - Proper ARIA labels
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader support
   - Responsive design
   - Error state handling
   - Loading states
   - Unit tests

3. **Documentation:** 🔄
   - Inline TSDoc comments
   - Usage examples
   - Props documentation
   - Accessibility notes
   - Error handling docs

## Confidence Assessment: 98% ✅
High confidence based on:
- Successfully implemented form components
- Completed error boundary setup
- Strong accessibility implementation
- Comprehensive documentation structure
- Clear next steps for layout components

## Next Action Required:
Ready to begin with Layout Components implementation! Type "Act" to start with the Card component. 🚀

## Notes:
- All form components are now fully implemented with accessibility features
- Error boundaries are in place and tested
- Documentation is being maintained as we progress
- Following mobile-first approach consistently
- Maintaining high TypeScript standards
- Successfully implementing WCAG 2.1 AA standards

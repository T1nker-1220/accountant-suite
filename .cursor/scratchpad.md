`YOU WILL NOT DELETE THIS LINE 1!!! YOU WILL READ THIS LINE 1. THERE'S OTHER TYPES OF MODE SYSTEM THAT YOU CAN USE THE FIRST ONE IS THE IMPLEMENTATION TYPE AND THE SECOND ONE IS FIXING THE BUG TYPE. YOU WILL USE THE FIRST ONE IF THE USER ASK YOU TO IMPLEMENT SOMETHING AND YOU WILL USE THE SECOND ONE IF THE USER ASK YOU TO FIX THE BUG WITH CHAIN OF THOUGHT. YOU WILL NOT DELETE THIS LINE 1!!!`

# Mode System Overview
Current Mode: Plan Mode 🎯

## Plan Mode (Default - Read Only)
- Focus on information gathering and solution architecture
- Activities include:
  - Reading and analyzing files
  - Asking clarifying questions
  - Conducting confidence assessments
  - Creating detailed implementation plans
- Must achieve 95% confidence before proceeding
- If confidence is lower:
  - List specific questions to clarify
  - Propose actions to increase confidence
  - Document assumptions and risks

## Act Mode (Requires Manual Activation)
- Can only be activated when user explicitly types "Act" in the composer
- Enables code modifications and action execution
- Requirements for activation:
  - Plan mode must be completed
  - User must approve the plan
  - Confidence score must be ≥ 95%
- Maintains traceability to original plan

# Phase 1 Implementation Plan - Core Accounting Features 🚀

## Current Progress:
[X] Next.js 14.1.0 App Router setup
[X] Supabase project created with credentials
[X] Project requirements documented
[X] User preferences clarified

## Next Steps (Priority Order):

### 1. Project Infrastructure Setup (Day 1) 🏗️
- [ ] Initialize core project structure following modular architecture:
  ```
  src/
  ├── app/               # Next.js app router
  ├── components/        # Reusable UI components
  │   ├── core/         # Base components
  │   ├── accounting/   # Domain-specific components
  │   └── shared/       # Cross-feature components
  ├── lib/
  │   ├── api/          # API clients
  │   ├── hooks/        # Custom hooks
  │   ├── utils/        # Helper functions
  │   └── validation/   # Zod schemas
  ├── types/            # Global TS types
  └── styles/           # Global Tailwind config
  ```
- [ ] Setup essential dependencies:
  - Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI
  - TypeScript configuration
  - Math.js for calculations
  - Zod for validation
  - Zustand for state management
  - Framer Motion for animations
  - Recharts for data visualization

### 2. Core Component Development (Day 2-3) 🛠️
- [ ] Create base UI components with Shadcn:
  - Button system (with ARIA labels)
  - Form inputs (with validation states)
  - Layout components (responsive)
  - Navigation elements (keyboard accessible)
  - Modal system (focus management)
  - Toast notifications (screen reader friendly)
- [ ] Implement professional color scheme:
  - Primary: Indigo (#4F46E5)
  - Secondary: Slate (#64748B)
  - Accent: Emerald (#10B981)
  - Error: Rose (#F43F5E)
  - Warning: Amber (#F59E0B)
  - Success: Green (#22C55E)
  - Background: White/Slate-50 (#F8FAFC)
- [ ] Prepare for future dark mode:
  - CSS variables for theme colors
  - Dark mode utility classes (commented)
  - Theme toggle component (disabled)

### 3. Calculation Engine Foundation (Day 4-5) 📊
- [ ] Implement core calculation modules:
  - Math.js integration
  - Basic depreciation calculator
  - Financial ratio formulas
  - Validation system setup

### 4. Testing Infrastructure (Day 6) 🧪
- [ ] Setup testing environment:
  - Unit test configuration
  - Component testing setup
  - Math formula validation tests
  - Error boundary implementation
  - Accessibility testing tools

## Confidence Assessment: 98% ✅
- High confidence in the plan based on:
  - Clear project requirements
  - Established tech stack
  - Defined architecture
  - Available Supabase infrastructure
  - User preferences clarified
  - Accessibility standards defined

## Implementation Decisions:
1. Dark Mode: Prepared but not implemented initially
2. Color Scheme: Professional financial theme with:
   - Focus on readability and contrast
   - Clean, modern aesthetic
   - Consistent with financial industry standards
3. Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with:
   - Color contrast ratios ≥ 4.5:1
   - Full keyboard navigation
   - ARIA labels and roles
   - Screen reader optimization
   - Responsive text sizing
   - Clear heading hierarchy

## Next Action:
Ready to begin implementation! Type "Act" to start with the infrastructure setup and dependency installation. 🚀

## Notes:
- Following mobile-first approach
- Implementing strict TypeScript configurations
- Ensuring comprehensive documentation
- Setting up proper error boundaries
- Following accessibility guidelines
- Preparing for future dark mode support
- Using professional financial color scheme

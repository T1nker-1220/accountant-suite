*This scratchpad file serves as a phase-specific task tracker and implementation planner. The Mode System on Line 1 is critical and must never be deleted. It defines two core modes: Implementation Type for new feature development and Bug Fix Type for issue resolution. Each mode requires specific documentation formats, confidence tracking, and completion criteria. Use "plan" trigger for planning phase (ðŸŽ¯) and "agent" trigger for execution phase (âš¡) after reaching 95% confidence. Follow strict phase management with clear documentation transfer process.*

`MODE SYSTEM TYPES (DO NOT DELETE!):
1. Implementation Type (New Features):
   - Trigger: User requests new implementation
   - Format: MODE: Implementation, FOCUS: New functionality
   - Requirements: Detailed planning, architecture review, documentation
   - Process: Plan mode (ðŸŽ¯) â†’ 95% confidence â†’ Agent mode (âš¡)

2. Bug Fix Type (Issue Resolution):
   - Trigger: User reports bug/issue
   - Format: MODE: Bug Fix, FOCUS: Issue resolution
   - Requirements: Problem diagnosis, root cause analysis, solution verification
   - Process: Plan mode (ðŸŽ¯) â†’ Chain of thought analysis â†’ Agent mode (âš¡)

# Mode: PLAN ðŸŽ¯

## Phase 1: Calculation Engine Foundation Implementation ðŸ§®

### Current Task
Planning and implementing the Calculation Engine Foundation with five main components:
1. Math.js Integration
2. Depreciation Calculator
3. Financial Ratio Formulas
4. Calculation Validation System
5. Unit Test Setup

### Implementation Timeline
Total Duration: 5 days

   - [ ] Install and configure math.js
   - [ ] Create utility wrapper for financial calculations
   - [ ] Set up TypeScript types
   - [ ] Implement error handling
   - [ ] Add documentation

2. Depreciation Calculator (1 day)
   - [ ] Implement straight-line depreciation
   - [ ] Create reusable calculation hooks
   - [ ] Add input validation
   - [ ] Implement result formatting
   - [ ] Create documentation

3. Financial Ratio Formulas (1 day)
   - [ ] Implement core financial ratios:
     - [ ] Liquidity ratios
     - [ ] Profitability ratios
     - [ ] Solvency ratios
     - [ ] Efficiency ratios
   - [ ] Add validation rules
   - [ ] Create documentation

4. Calculation Validation System (1 day)
   - [ ] Implement Zod schemas
   - [ ] Create validation hooks
   - [ ] Add error messages
   - [ ] Implement boundary checks
   - [ ] Create documentation

5. Unit Test Setup (1 day)
   - [ ] Set up Jest configuration
   - [ ] Create test utilities
   - [ ] Write test cases
   - [ ] Add test documentation
   - [ ] Implement CI integration

### Progress Tracking
- Current Phase: 1 - Calculation Engine Foundation
- Status: Planning Stage
- Confidence: Initial Assessment

### Questions for Implementation
1. Math.js Integration:
   - Do we need custom financial functions beyond math.js?
   - Should we implement caching for complex calculations?
   - What level of precision is required for calculations?
   - How should we handle currency calculations?

2. Depreciation Calculator:
   - What depreciation methods beyond straight-line are needed?
   - Should we support multiple currencies?
   - What date handling requirements exist?
   - What validation rules are needed?

3. Financial Ratios:
   - Which specific ratios are highest priority?
   - What industry standards need to be followed?
   - How should we handle historical data?
   - What visualization requirements exist?

4. Validation System:
   - What are the boundary conditions for each calculation?
   - How should we handle edge cases?
   - What error message format is preferred?
   - Should we implement warning thresholds?

5. Testing Strategy:
   - What test coverage percentage is required?
   - Should we include performance tests?
   - How should we mock complex calculations?
   - What documentation format for tests?

### Next Steps
1. Await user input on implementation questions
2. Set up development environment for math.js
3. Create initial test cases
4. Begin documentation structure

### Dependencies
- math.js for calculations
- Zod for validation
- Jest for testing
- TypeScript for type safety
- date-fns for date calculations

### Technical Considerations
1. Performance:
   - Optimize calculation speed
   - Implement caching where needed
   - Handle large datasets efficiently

2. Security:
   - Validate all inputs
   - Sanitize numerical data
   - Prevent calculation exploits

3. Accessibility:
   - Clear error messages
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader support

4. Documentation:
   - Inline TSDoc comments
   - Usage examples
   - API documentation
   - Test coverage reports


### Next Steps
Awaiting user input on implementation questions to proceed with detailed planning.
